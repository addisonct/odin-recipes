        <h2>Homemade Caprese Salad with Balsamic Reduction</h2>
        <p>This caprese salad features tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil drizzled with a sweet balsamic reduction and olive oil. Easy, impressive, and delicious! Most grocery stores now sell prepared balsamic reductions. Surprisingly it's just as good!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey</li>
            <li>3 large tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir balsamic vinegar and honey together in a small saucepan and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Arrange alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella decoratively on a serving platter. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, tuck basil leaves around slices, and drizzle with olive oil and the balsamic reduction.</li>
        </ol>
